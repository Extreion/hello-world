# hello-world
First repository, just to understand how GitHub works.


Ok, so apparently I created a branch of my project. The main projet is called master, and I created a branch called readme-edits. I can do whatever I want on this branch, it won't change the master branch until I say that I want to change it. Cool stuff !
